# Horiseon

This website has been enhanced with accessibility functionality to allow those who use screenreaders to help them understand the information on a webpage.
The code has edited to consolidate repeated elements and add comments to make it easier to read. Semantic elements such as header, nav, section have been
specified to makes the CSS styles page easier to understand, and different classes with the same details have been grouped to shorten the code.
